# Welcome to my Data Science Portfolio(coded in R) importeed from https://www.kaggle.com/jkevin2010

This repository contains the Data science projects I have been working on using Data sets from www.Kaggle.com

My Actual portfolio with visual outputs can be found in the Kernel section of my data science profile at https://www.kaggle.com/jkevin2010

I will also include Data forecasting projects using Time Series Analysis 

## Getting Started
In the Titanic survial project, I used two different prediction models to predict survival rates. I used a machine learning algorithm called decision trees to predict the survival of people that were on the titanic using the provided data set accessible on www.kaggle.com
