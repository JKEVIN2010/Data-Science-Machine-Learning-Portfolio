This repository contains data science projects I have been working on using various datasets found on www.kaggle.com

## Getting Started
In the Titanic survial project, I used two different prediction models to predict survival rates. I used a machine learning algorithm called decision trees to predict the survival of people that were on the titanic using the provided data set accessible on www.kaggle.com
